  Note: get template name a different way because usually there's only one
  directory, but da is already using that. Only need it if using jinja templating.
  Separation of content from code.
  
  Q: How to get files and folders?
  
  Flask is only for intermediate progress
  
  ======= INSTEAD =======
  Fake endpoint with an event that js can poll. Same as regular endpoint. Event
  returns some text or binary result. js - use url_action() to run an event with
  some params. `GET`. https://docassemble.org/docs/functions.html#js_url_action
  Character based, unfortunately. Somehow this has something to do with REDIS.

  Background process for just output
  https://docassemble.org/docs/background.html (running code behind the scenes,
  copy all and modify)
  Dashboard might have some background stuff
  https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/docassemble-ALDashboard/blob/main/docassemble/ALDashboard/data/questions/install_packages.yml
  Try `ls` or something (like the `echo` I got running)
  https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html
  Get files from the subprocess. How to show them? In bootstrap stuff Bryce did.

    Point a da file (how?) to the file you create from the output.
    Maybe parse the output to see where it's saved and then copy them
    Images, text files, pdfs, docxs
    Can't direct link
    Get directory and file name (os.listdir?) (list files in directory)
      https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-list-files-in-a-directory/ (look for better source)
    DAFile method to copy it into the DAFile and serve it with...? How to get it
    from js back into DA? Not using js for just a background process.
    Can provide zip file MVP. Show files v2 or v3.
